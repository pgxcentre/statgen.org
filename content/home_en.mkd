# Our vision

Our group is interested in the development and application of statistical
genetics in the field of cardiovascular diseases and pharmacogenomics.

One of the main projects in the group presently is the analysis of a genetic
study on muscle pain related to statin-use in a case-control study of 4,600
participants collected in 9 collaborating centres throughout Quebec. We are
also in the process of starting the data collection for our pharmacogenomic
study of warfarin, which aims to sample 2,500 incident users in a prospective
observational study in Quebec. We have also been involved in the analysis of
pharmacogenomic sub-studies of three phase-3 clinical trials and one phase-2
trial related to treatment for cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia.

We work in close collaboration with scientists at the Beaulieu-Saucier
Pharmacogenomics Center at the Montreal Heart Institute. We also participate in
productive collaborative efforts with clinicians and scientists at the Montreal
Heart Institute, at the Universite de Montr√©al, University of British Columbia,
Memorial University in Newfoundland, Dalhousie in Halifax, and abroad, with
whom we collaborate on various statistical genetics applications including
family-based genetic projects, animal and human genetic studies.
