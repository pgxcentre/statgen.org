# Tools

## [Forward](https://github.com/legaultmarc/forward)

*forward* is a bioinformatics utility to execute, manage and explore phenomic
studies. It's documentation is available
[here](http://legaultmarc.github.io/forward/).
[An issue tracker](https://github.com/legaultmarc/forward/issues) for this
project (which can be used for feature requests) is also available.


## [genipe](https://github.com/pgxcentre/genipe)

*genipe* is an automatic pipeline to perform genome-wide imputation analysis on
a genotyped dataset. Full documentation is available
[here](http://pgxcentre.github.io/genipe/), and installation
instruction [here](http://pgxcentre.github.io/genipe/installation.html) and in
the [README](https://github.com/pgxcentre/genipe/blob/master/README.mkd) file.


## [pyplink](https://github.com/lemieuxl/pyplink)

*pyplink* is an open source python module that enables working with Plink binary
files without having to first convert them to text files. The
[README](https://github.com/lemieuxl/pyplink/blob/master/README.mkd) file
contains a description of how to use this module.


## [pyGenClean]({{ lang_root }}/tools/pygenclean.html)

*pyGenClean* is a bioinformatics tool to facilitate and standardize the genetic
data clean up pipeline with genotyping array data. In conjunction with a source
batch-queuing system, the tool minimizes data manipulation errors, it
accelerates the completion of the data clean up process and it provides
informative graphics and metrics to guide decision making for statistical
analysis.


## [CNV Analysis Toolkit](http://statgen.org/wp-content/uploads/Softwares/CNVAnalysisToolkit/cnv_analysis_toolkit.tar.gz)

This set of tools was created for the study of whole genome sequencing based
algorithms for CNV genotyping in monozygotic twins families.


## [CNGen]({{ lang_root }}/tools/cngen.html)

We have created a script that converts integrated SNP and CNV calls generated
from Birdsuite's Fawkes procedure into phased copy number genotypes (CN
genotypes) using familial pedigree data. This software makes possible the use
of CNPs and CNVs for genetic linkage with family data.


## [Chip2Spell]({{ lang_root }}/tools/chip2spell.html)

We have created a program that automatically generates the input files for
*Alohomora_m*. The program, *Chip2Spell*, takes as input a genotype report and
publicly available annotation files and creates the genotype file, map file and
frequency file that will be used by *Alohomora*. The program is especially
useful if the map and frequency files for a given platform are not stored in
the *Alohomora* library, but it is also a quick way to convert the standard
Affymetrix or Illumina genotype report format to the AB format requested by
*Alohomora*.


## [Gene-environment interactions]({{ lang_root }}/tools/gene_env_inter.html)

We have created some code that performs a GWAS analysis of gene-environment
interactions for imputed SNPs and non-imputed SNPs. Instead of using PLINK to
perform the logistic regressions or the generalized linear model, we used the
PLINK's R plug-in function to do it for the non-imputed SNPs.


## [MAX test]({{ lang_root }}/tools/max_test.html)

We have coded the MAX test of Zheng and Gastwirth (Statist. Med. 2006;25:3150)
in some SAS MACROS. As well, we have created a wrapper for our MAX test code
that allows the user to correct for multiple testing by using the maxT
algorithm (Alg 4.1 of Westfall and Young, 1993).
